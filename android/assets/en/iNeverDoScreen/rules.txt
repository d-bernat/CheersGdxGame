You’ll see at the screen for example a sentence like this: ,,I never had … a pet.,,  Anyone who at some point in their lives has done the action or had the situation that the screen says, must drink.
A further variation holds that whenever only one person is drinking, that person must give a detailed account of why they are drinking. Another variation of this game involves putting up five or ten fingers, putting one down whenever something mentioned has been done. Those who end up putting down all of their fingers must take several successive drinks.                                                                                                   Have fun! ;)
