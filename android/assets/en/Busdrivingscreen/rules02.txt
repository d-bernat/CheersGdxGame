2. Phase
In the 2. phase you'll see a pyramid. In the first row you can pass a sip to someone, in the second row two sips and so on. You don't need to lay down a card, you can wait and lay it down later, maybe you can pass on more sips. The player which has the most cards at the end of the game has to drive the bus. If two or more players have the same amount of cards there will be an overtime and one after another will choose if the card is higher or lower than the card on the screen.
