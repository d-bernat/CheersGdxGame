5: Counter
You will pick a number between 1-8, maybe three
and a word like cheesecake. Then you start to count. 
PlayerA: 1; PlayerB: 2 and so on. The next player 
who needs to say 3 or a number which is a multple 
of a 3 (3, 6, 9, 12) or a number that contains 
a 3 (like 13, 23, 33) has to say the chosen 
word instead.
