Kings Cup Special is a drinking game that uses playing cards.  
Every player must drink and dispense drinks based on cards drawn. 
Each card has a rule. You need alcoholic beverages and a large cup which will be used as the 
King's Cup. Each player takes turn drawing cards with the Wheel and the players must 
participate in the instructions corresponding to the drawn card. It will be shown. The game 
is officially over after the fourth king. Of course you can change your rules.
